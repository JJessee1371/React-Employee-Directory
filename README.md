# React-Employee-Directory
## Desscription
It's important to be able to track vital employee information and rapidly sort through large data sets to locate
desired information. Using React, I have constrcuted an application that takes in employee data and displays it in an organized table that is easily readable. In order to facilitate the ability to quickly locate employees 
or managers based on data that is stored in the table, there are options to both sort all of the existing data as well as to filter it to locate only employees that meet specific criteria.
